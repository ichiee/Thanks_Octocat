First Class Function
    function can be used the same as other variables. 
    it can be passed as a parameter / argument
    (see first-class-fn.js for examples)

module
      require to receive module.export on module file 
      (see module_01 folder)
      when you first get, it is an empty object. 
      You will be overwriting it by assign function
  
require 
      can recognise different type of files such as js, json and etc 
      (on module.js  extentions are property name on a object and the values are function to sort things out)
      
      When you require file without extension of js, it will look for one with.js (see module.js)
      If not existing the js file, then it will look for the same name folder, 
      so let’s say if you have a folder called greet and require (‘./greet’), all the files in the folder will be required.
	    
      In this case you can create multiple files, organise them with index.js

exports 
	is short hand of module.export as exports is parameter of the IIFE wrapped the module.  
	However when you assign exports, you need to mutate the object such as
	export.greet = function (){}
	Instead of exports = function…
	It will dereference from what module.exports points at, will point at just the function 
	module.exports remain to points at the same object. 
	This is odd js behaviour 

Native (core) Module 
	You can require each library which are not global as
		var util = require ('util');
	When you don’t need to specify the location, the js will look into the core.
	
ES6 examples (V8 supports ES6)
		export function greet(){ console.log (‘Hello’); }
	Use export on function it means module.exports

	App.js side, you can import anything that has that export tag on it using import keyword.
	I	mport * as greetr from ‘greet’;
		greetr.greet();

Events
	1: System Events come from C++ Core Libuv
		Events coming from computer syetem such as finishe reading file, received data etc whch js doesnt have
	2: Custom Events - Javascript core Event Emitter
		When events occers in libuv, it generates custom event often. JS side is faking it



  
  
Using require(‘./whatever_path.js)  && module.exports
        
        What is happening under the hood

        whatever_yourmodule.js has module.js underneath
        module.js is one of javaScript files that built into Node

        Node wraps codes (module code) inside a function expression
        So then Node actually invokes the function

                (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
                      // your code here together with module.export =
                });
                fn (module.exports, require, module, filename, dirname);
                return module.exports;  // this is what is really coming back from require.

        require is function, that you pass the path too, 
        module.exports is what require function returns. object is passed by reference.

        This works because your code is actually wrapped in a function giving these things as function parameter. 
        Your code is the body of the function


    

Common Module Patterns (see module_patters folder)

  1: simple over write
          var greet = function (){
            console.log ('Hello world');
          };
          module.exports = greet;
          &
          var greet1 = require('./greet1');
          greet1();  
  
  2: moule.export dot object
          module.exports.greet = function (){
            console.log ('Hello world!');
          };
          &
          var greet2 = require('./greet2').greet;
          greet2();
  
  3: Constructor with new on export (by reference)
            module.exports = new Greetr
            &
            var greet3 = require('./greet3');
            greet3.greet();
            greet3.greeting = 'changed hello world';
  
  4: Basic Constructer 
            module.exports = Greetr
            &
            var Greet4 = require('./greet4'); 
            var grtr = new Greet4(); 
            grtr.greet()
  
  5: revealing module pattern 
            module.export = {
                greet:greet
            }
            &
            var greet5 = require ('./greet5').greet;
            greet5();
