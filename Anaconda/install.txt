-bash: /Users/satokoichimura/.bash_profile: line 86: syntax error: unexpected end of file

when I open terminal
It was left over from previous mess of setting up vertualenvwrapper daaa.

$ cat >> ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH
Did not work

what I needed to do was

export PATH="$HOME/anaconda/bin:$PATH"

YES WORKED!!!!
