ChatGPT != GPT3 (or whatever version): ChatGPT is a tool cretaed on with GPT3 api. there are fine tuning and all other fuctions to make it as good as it is
Other company's tool cannot be as good as ChatGPT if they are not soing well

Fine turning != adding more data into the system
Fine tuning == help system to recognise new patterns and respond appropriately (pattern recognistion training)
