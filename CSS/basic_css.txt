wild card * with the marginset to make t=it iat the canter
      * {
      margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
      text-align : left;
      }

make the container width fix to max

inline trick ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    float 
        if you use float attribute, it will stick to (let's say left) 
        and the next elements comes righ after (right side of the elements) if there is enough space

        clear:both; - to cancel out both side float if there are both so you can start new row/line
        

    nav bar example
        on <ul> set display:inline; to all flow against each other
        on <a> (which is in each ul) set float:left;


Tricks

visited: 
  if you code in {}, the link won't change after visited
  the same as hover
      #menu a, #menu a:visited{

      }
      
 border-bottom: 1px dashed #fff - pin under-line  
 
 text-decolation:nane: - get rid of underline on <a> tag
 
 list-style: none; - get rid of bullet point of ul
      
 border-radius : 10px; 
 
 line-height: 10px - space between line
 
 font-size:110%; - if you wanna make the size big
      
 table, td, tr - all set to margin :0 first to clear any dependacies, so easier to manage
